Hi, I’m Luis 

I am an electrical engineering student in my last semester at UNM. 

I initially wanted to go into hardware engineering, even though it is a strong interest, I started to learn about AWS (Amazon web services.)  

Working on some project's over the summer, I found a soultions to workflow problems only possible through software and could be made better using AWS or other cloud based services.  

Currently: Learning to use AWS cloud soultions. 

Here is how to reach me!
